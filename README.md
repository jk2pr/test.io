# GitHub Users App

This project is an Android application that fetches a list of GitHub users, displays them in a paginated list, and allows users to view detailed profiles. The app is designed with a focus on best practices in Android development, including the use of Kotlin, Room for data persistence, and Jetpack Compose for UI.
